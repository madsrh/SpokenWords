# SpokenWords
The **Spoken Words Sound Theme** is a simple set of standard system sounds for Linux. The name of each sound (_as found in the_ [_freedesktop sound naming specification_](http://0pointer.de/public/sound-naming-spec.html)) is read out loud, so the users knows which sound was triggered. This was created for testing purposes only and is not meant for daily usage.
